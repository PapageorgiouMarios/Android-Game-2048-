Todays project is all about math 🤓✏! 

**2048** is a popular single-player puzzle game created in 2014 where players slide numbered tiles on a 4×4 grid to combine them and reach the elusive **2048** tile. In our case, we want something greater in both number and achievement.

## How to Play  
- Swipe in any direction (Up, Down, Left, Right) to move all tiles.  
- When two tiles with the same number collide, they merge into one with double the value.  
- A new tile (usually 2 or 4) appears after every move.   

## Features  
✔️ Simple yet addictive gameplay  
✔️ Requires strategy and planning  
✔️ Play endlessly to achieve higher scores beyond 2048  

## How to win  

- All you have to do is reach the number **65,536** (2¹⁶). If you don't have any available moves during play, you lose. But don't worry. You can always retry 😋
